## Data Structures

### Introduction

Different data structure excel at different situations

Example:
* Working with Map / Location data (or) code that routes us to nearest gas station - **Graph** 
* Ordered list with fast inserts at removal or end - **Linked List**
* Web scraped HTML data - **Tree**
* Scheduler (which has tasks that are scheduled, which is the highest priority task to handle) - **Binary Heap**
